            Everything on the previous site was not only the same design and layout from 2 years ago, but it was entirely outdated... so the Oinkcraft website revamp has officially begun! See below for the plan<hr>
            <h4 class = "construction-schedule-header">Progress Update
                <i class = "construction-schedule-text">The website is still on our minds, but the game server is taking first priority. We've all got interest in web dev, but in terms of where the site is at we are currently
                     still in mockup phase. The sponsor page is just waiting on some art, and the updates page is being written with some backend magic by Matt! :D<br>
                     In the mean time, our Discord server is lively as ever and we will give you a warm welcome.
