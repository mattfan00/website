            Everything on the previous site was not only the same design and layout from 2 years ago, but it was entirely outdated... so the Oinkcraft website revamp has officially begun! See below for the plan<hr>
            <h4 class = "construction-schedule-header">December 2019:<i class = "construction-schedule-text">Detailed information page, a link to information about our sponsor ranks and checkout, and an auto-populating updates page.</i></h4>

            <h4 class = "construction-schedule-header">Mid-January 2020:<i class = "construction-schedule-text">A basic-functioning forums page, that will be continually worked on and improved.</i></h4>
            <br>
            <h4 class = "construction-schedule-header">Just as a note...<i class = "construction-schedule-text">Mark is- I mean, I am- currently working on this solo, and have found web design super fun! I'm currently focusing on finishing my own website by the end of October, then Oinkcraft is up next! Once winter break rolls around, the time I'll have will be AWESOME! I hope everyone is excited as I am :)</i></h4>
