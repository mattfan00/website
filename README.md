# Oinkcraft Website Repository
Official repo for the Oinkcraft website

## Repo Structure
Please make all PRs and fixes to the `develop` branch, NOT the master branch! We will merge to master when the website ends up being updated so that we can keep track of larger updates.

## Navigation

### Assets
Here are all the photoshop files, models, logos, etc. that are worked on for the website. _DO NOT access this folder for website images.

### root
This is where all the site files reside. Use the `img` and respective directories for any and all site-accessed files.

## What to ignore
Please remember to add all SQL and/or privatized files, i.e. hashing, to the git ignore!

Thanks :)
